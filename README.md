# Dotpiles

These are my dotfiles.  They get symlinkned into place using [bcomnes/ansible-dotfiles](https://github.com/bcomnes/ansible-dotfiles).

There are too many variables for a one-size fits all installation, but typically these files are put into place using config management... Look there.

## File Layout

Working with hidden files sucks more than having to select the correct syntax highlighting manually when editing.

1. Remove all `.` prefixes from files that this repo aims to develop.  Let the boostrapping method hand that.

2. Load generated files and keep uninteresting platform specific details out of these files.


## Directory Layout

Directories are for looping over, and complicated loops suck.  Therefore:

1. All files that belong in `~/` should live in `/dotfiles`.

2. Recreate the folder structure you want for wacky config folders sub directories.

3. Dont keep empty required directories around.  Ensure their creation with ansible.

## Staying in sync

It's nice to be able to quickly `vim ~/.foo`.  Therefore these files should be symlinked into place with the init script.

Files that should not be edited (because they were generated, etc) should note this in a comment header and be generated by the thing that generates them.
